##' Adjusted Risk
##'
##' Calculate the adjusted risk for each of the unit risk groups
##' (URG). This can be used at both the herd and the animal level. The
##' proportion vector, for herd level, is therefore the proportion
##' herds in the population that are in each of the unit risk
##' groups. The proportion vector for animal level is the proportion
##' of animals within a given herd that are in each URG.

##' @param prop A vector of proportions of the population that belong
##'     to each URG (Unit risk group)
##' @param RR A vector of the relative risks of for each URG. The
##'     first of these is the referent group and therefore must be
##'     equal to 1
##' @return A vector of Adjusted risks

##' EffProbInf
##'
##' Calculate the effective probability of infection (EPI) for each unsit
##' risk group in the population. This could be either at the herd
##' level or within herd level. The dp for herds is therefore the
##' minimum prevlance among herds that you would like to design the
##' surveillance system to be able to detect. The dp for within herds
##' is therefore the minimum prevalance of the disease within a herd
##' among the animals that you would like to design the surveillance
##' system to detect.
