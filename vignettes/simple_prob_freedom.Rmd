# Here is a simple example of  probability of freedom calculation

You have a population of 10000 herds of which 500 are tested per year
using a test that has a herd sensitivity (HSe) of 20%; all of these
tests were negative. You need to calculate the annual surveillance
system sensitivity (SysSe) and the probability that the disease has a
lower than 1% prevalance (dp) in the population of herd over time given a
prior assuption that the probability of the disease being in the
popuatlion is 50% (prior_pr). You also assume that the annual cummulative
probabiilty of introduction to the population is 1% (prob_intro).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(freedom)

Hse <- rep(0.2, 500)
dp <- rep(0.01, 500)
SysSe <- sysse(dp, Hse)

```

So the susrveillance system has a sensitivity of detecting the
disease at a prevalance of greater than of equal to `r dp[1]`of  `r SysSe`.
